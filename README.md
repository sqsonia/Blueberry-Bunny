# Blueberry Bunny Sort

Blueberry Bunny Sort is a cozy browser puzzle where fruit-shaped bunnies hop between glass tubes. Group every bunny by its favorite flavor to win — and make sure the blueberry bunch sticks together.

## Features

- 🫐 A blueberry bunny family plus strawberry, peach, kiwi, grape, citrus, melon, plum, cherry, and dragonfruit friends to juggle.
- ✋ Smooth drag-and-drop stacks with keyboard access for players who prefer it.
- 📈 Ten handcrafted levels that add more tubes, helper slots, and fruit bunny families as you advance.
- 🎯 Win detection with a celebratory modal that jumps you to the next level or restarts the adventure.
- � Level five assistance: unlock optional helper powers to spawn an extra tube or skip ahead if the board gets too wild.
- �🌈 Hand-crafted visuals: soft gradients, glass tubes, and cute bunny faces with fruit-inspired details.

## How to play

1. Drag the top stack of matching fruit bunnies from one tube toward another.
2. Drop them onto any tube that has enough room for the whole stack—mixing flavors is totally fine.
3. Keep sorting until every tube is filled with a single fruit flavor to unlock the next level. Prefer keys? Focus a tube and press Enter/Space to pick up or drop.
4. Stuck at level five or beyond? Use the assist panel to call in an extra helper tube or skip forward once per level.

## Run locally

No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly in your browser or start a lightweight web server from the project folder:

```powershell
powershell -NoExit -Command "Start-Process msedge.exe '$(Resolve-Path ./index.html)'"
```

Or, if you prefer a static server with live reload, use your favorite tool (such as `npx serve`) and point it at the project directory.
